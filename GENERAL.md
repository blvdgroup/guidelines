# blvd general guidelines

## Conduct

All projects within the blvd group contain a Code of Conduct, found in these
guidelines as [CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/blvdgroup/guidelines/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).
This Code of Conduct is a version of the Contributor Covenant, and it's very
simple to summarize:

- Be nice.
- Do not be sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc.
- Do not use sexual imagery or language.
- Do not troll or harass other people.
- Do not publish personal information ("dox").

Failure to comply by any of the standards outlined here will result in
repercussions. Do not break the rules.

## Contributing

Projects within the blvd group have a wide variety of contributors from all
backgrounds. One should be friendly and welcoming when contributing to issues
and pull requests.

### Regular Contributors

Regular contributors to any project are eligible to become "members" of the blvd
group, earning an @blvd.space email address and group membership under the teams
which they contribute to. This is left to the discretion of the leaders of the
blvd group.

## Licensing

All projects within the blvd group should be licensed under the Apache license
2.0. This is a fairly common FOSS license, and we do not modify it in any
manner. When referring to the copyright owner, "the blvd group" should be used.

## Monetizing

_Note: I realize this is pretty far out, and these guidelines are fluid since at
the moment nothing here is even close to making money. I want to make sure I
establish early that money earned by blvd must go only back into blvd and OS
projects. The rest is flexible._

Any and all money earned by any blvd project must go entirely back into the
development and maintainance of existing blvd projects. Money earned enters a
pool wherein it may be applied to any project within the group which requires
it.

### Advertisements

Projects within the blvd group must not, under any circumstances, display
advertisements unless they meet the following guidelines:

- They must not be animated, even upon user interaction.
- They must clearly mark themselves as sponsored content.
- They must not intrude upon the page.
  - As a general rule of thumb, you should never be able to screenshot your
    website and have more than 2% of the page covered in advertisements.

We are not currently partered with any advertising agencies.

## Branding

"the blvd group" should:

- Always be referred to entirely in lowercase.
  - **Good:** the blvd group, `the blvd group`
  - **Bad:** The blvd group, The BLVD group
- Always be referred to as blvd or the blvd group, preferrably the latter.
  - **Good:** the blvd group, blvd
  - **Bad:** the blvd, blvd group, the group, the, group

Use of the blvd logo should be restricted to situations where an image would be
thematically appropriate. Logo assets, and sample variations on the logo, can be
found in this repository, under the assets folder.

## Dogs

When you see a dog, you must obnoxiously point it out to all friends you have
present, saying only "dog!" in a high pitched, excited voice. If the dog passes
by you, you must respectfully ask to pet the dog, and if granted permission, pet
the dog thoroughly.
